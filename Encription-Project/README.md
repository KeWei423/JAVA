# Project Description: 
This program asks the user whether they would like to encode or decode a message (e/E, d/D), and then encodes or decodes the message using the mapping above. 
Capital letters are mapped the same way as the lower case letters, but remain capitalized. 
For example, every 'A' becomes a 'K' when encoding, and every 'K' becomes an 'A' when decoding. 
Numbers and other characters are not encoded and remain the same. 
The program repeatedly asks the user for input until the user quits (q/Q).
