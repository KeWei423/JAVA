# Demostration of Data process:

  1. process files containing records for students attending UC schools and find those who are PCC alumni. 
  2. Write a program that reads in a file containing UC student records and another file containing PCC alumni records
  3. Write out to a file all the PCC alumni who are attending UC schools, ordered by ID.
    The IDs in both files match and are unique to a student, however, there may be students who share the exact same name
    (e.g. Mr. John Smith and Ms. Jane Doe occur multiple times with different IDs)
